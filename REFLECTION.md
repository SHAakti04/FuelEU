# Reflection on AI-Assisted Development

This project demonstrated how AI can significantly accelerate development when used responsibly.

## What I Learned
- AI is excellent for scaffolding and iteration
- Domain logic still requires human validation
- Architecture decisions must remain developer-driven

## Efficiency Gains
- Faster setup of Prisma repositories
- Rapid UI prototyping
- Easier debugging of TypeScript errors

## Limitations
- AI occasionally hallucinated APIs
- Required manual correction for regulatory accuracy

## Improvements Next Time
- Use AI earlier for test generation
- Automate schema validation prompts
- Use smaller, more constrained prompts

Overall, AI was a **force multiplier**, not a replacement for engineering judgment.
